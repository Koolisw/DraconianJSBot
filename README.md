**Dev Branch**

New features and Enhancements are introduced:

- Mostly written by **_typescript_**
- Redesigning bot handling logic
- Discord.js v13 or the up-coming v14
- Supporting the latest/LTS nodejs versions
- Improving speed and memory usage
- Better multi-server supports
- Expected stable release: early June

Expected extra features:

1. Better customization
2. Unifying bot command layout and content
3. Level system
4. Anti spam
5. Interaction features like **member counting channel**, **User cpatcha verification** and so forth

Unfortunately, these features will be removed in next main release:

1. NSFW commands

3. Giveaway commands
4. Imaging commands
